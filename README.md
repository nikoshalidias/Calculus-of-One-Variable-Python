# 🧮 Calculus of One Variable in Python

Explore the beauty of *single-variable calculus* through Python code, symbolic computation, and visualizations.

This repository contains examples, notebooks, and modules that demonstrate fundamental topics of calculus — from limits and derivatives to integrals and infinite series — using libraries such as **SymPy**, **NumPy**, and **Matplotlib**.
